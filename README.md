# Satellite Images Prediction 
In this report, random forests and multinomial logistic regression are used on the dataset Satellite
available in package mlbench contains 6435 images displaying different scenes recorded by the
Landsat satellite program. Each row of the data correspond to an image, which encodes a scene in
terms of 36 features extracted from multi-spectral values of pixels in 3x3 neighborhoods of the
image.

The task is to predict the classification of the satellite images. In doing so, both models are
compared and based on the generalization performance evaluation, we can find the best model.

## Methods
- Random Forest
- Multinomial Logistic Regression


The code is based on STAT30270 - Statistical Machine Learning Module (by Michael Fop) with additional modification
